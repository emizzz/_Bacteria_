PLAY
 
 The play method is where the sound output is sended to the openFrameworks sound handlers.
 It is called in the ofApp's audioOut method!
 
 The 3 passed parameters are the same as the audioOut() method.
 
 The soundtrack's timer is different from the game's timer, so the soundtrack's time is not constrained to the game's time.
 
 The for loop considers the buffer structure [left ch, right ch, left ch, right ch, ...]
